== Description ==
The Pattern Organizer plugin adds an easy, quick link access to the custom patterns page, right from the Appearance Menu. The patterns page is where all your custom patterns like reusable blocks are saved.

Block only themes allow user to manage and control their custom patterns directly from the Site Editor, but few major themes does not provide the feature to edit, modify, or delete custom patterns and Reusaable Blocks according to the users need.

-Patterns that use plugins other than the default Gutenberg Block, may still need to use those plugins for the customization patterns.
